## ProgrammingAssignment2 - hforsythe 1/24/15
## The functions below cache potentially time-consuming computations
## for a matrix inversion and make the results available for repeated use.

## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object 
## that can cache its inverse.
## For this assignment, we assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## then the cachesolve retrieves the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
